# School Books Archive

A React + Vite project documenting the storybooks and setbooks we read throughout primary and high school during 8-4-4 system.  
This archive captures the literature that shaped my early reading journey.

## About the Project

**School Books Archive** serves as a digital record of story books that were part of the 8-4-4 system and the highschool setbooks.  
Each entry includes details such as:
- Book title and author
